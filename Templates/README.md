In these folders, you'll find the most basic examples. They should be treated as templates to kickstart new projects. All of the examples in this repo started from here, and have been extended to show specific features.

Folders:

- **NodeJS**: Has the code in JavaScript.
- **Particle**: Has the code written in C++, specific to Particle itself.

How can C++ be specific to just one device? Because, in this case, I'm using classes that are specific to Particle. For example, the TCPClient is a implementation made by Particle.

Depending on your device, youâ€™ll need to use something else. Just be sure that it works in a similar manner to Particle.
