In this folders you'll find the most basic examples. They should be treated as templates to kickstart new projects. All the Examples in this repo started from this place, and have been extended to show a specific feature.

Folders:

- NodeJS: has the code in JavaScript.
- Particle: have code written in C++ specific to Particle itself.

How can C++ be specific to just one device? Because in this case I'm using classes that are specific for Particle. For example the TCPClient is a implementation made by Particle. Depending on your device youâ€™ll have to use something else, but still similar in its working.
