This example is an extension of the `Hardware2NodeJS` project. The difference in this case is on the NodeJS side. This time the code handles properly the buffering of transmitted data. The buffering is specific to the TCP protocol, and since it is done on the hardware level we can't control it - I'm talking about the network card, known also as the NIC (Network Interface Controller).

Our code now will display each value in a new line as before, but now it will take in consideration a longer string with multiple values which were buffered. Thanks to our separator in the form of a `,`, our loop can chop the string in the right place, and display each number in a separate line.
