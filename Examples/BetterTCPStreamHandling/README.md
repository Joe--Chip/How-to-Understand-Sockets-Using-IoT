This example is an extension of the `Hardware2NodeJS` project. The difference in this case is on the NodeJS side. This time, the code properly handles the buffering of transmitted data. The buffering is specific to the TCP protocol, and since it is done on the hardware level, we can't control it - I'm talking about the network card, known also as the NIC (Network Interface Controller).

Our code will now display each value on a new line, as before, but now it will take into consideration a longer string with multiple values, which have been buffered. Thanks to our comma separator, our loop can chop the string in the right place, and display each number on a separate line.
